UI components that just look kinda "apple-y." Just imagine Apple saying "ayo, time for some human interface!" Like, what the hell, human interface? They're literally naming inexistent things and just call them a "concept." Oops, seems like our Apple fans are getting angry! Fine. Apple is the best company in the world. What now? NVIDIA?
