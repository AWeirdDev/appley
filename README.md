UI components that just look kinda "apple-y." Just imagine Apple saying "ayo, time for some human interface!" Like, what the hell, human interface? They're literally naming inexistent things and just call them a "concept." Oops, seems like our Apple fans are getting angry! Fine. Apple is the best company in the world. What now? NVIDIA?

## Components
We got some components packed up for you! Yes, it took some time copying & pasting those color codes. I mean, c'mon, there's gotta be someone good at this! I'm a total noob in React and CSS, so pweeease don't hurt me &gt;///\&lt;

Alright, enough talk, let's dive in!

```jsx
<>
    <Button size="sm">$69.99</Button>
    <Button size="md">Start</Button>
    <Button size="lg">Run</Button>
</>
```
